This is my project about a Sync Tracker for The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time Randomizer.
This is not meant to be used in a tournament but more, for beginners and streamer to have their community join and know exactly the hint he gots and the checks he already made

This is currently in dev, and PHP files aren't showned because there is confidential passwords for the database used.
